            We currently operate as pet project without profit. We do NOT ask users to identify themselves, and 
            only track analytics to ensure decent site performance and debug errors. We serve ads to cover costs, and any 
            proceeds that may arise are currently donated to the respective charities depending on what you are looking at 
            and voting on. The proceeds will go to: POW, Surf Rider, SaveOurStages, Adventure Cycling Assocation.
